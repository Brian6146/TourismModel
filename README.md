Wildlife Image Classification Model for Game Drivers
Overview
This machine learning model is designed to classify images of various wildlife animals captured at different points within a national park. The model helps game drivers by providing predictions on the species of animals in the images, along with insights into potential locations and times where these animals can be spotted. By utilizing image data from the park, the model aids in guiding drivers to areas where specific wildlife is most likely to be found, enhancing the overall wildlife observation experience for park visitors.

Features
Wildlife Classification: The model can accurately identify multiple species of animals captured in images taken by game drivers or cameras throughout the park.
Location Prediction: Based on image metadata, the model can help suggest potential regions where animals are commonly seen, enabling better navigation.
Time-based Insights: Using temporal data from image timestamps, the model can predict the most likely times of day for sightings of different animals in specific locations.
How It Works
Data Collection: The model is trained using a large dataset of images of various animal species captured at different GPS locations and times within the national park. The dataset also includes metadata (time, date, GPS coordinates) linked with each image.

Model Training: A deep learning-based approach is used to train the model, employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify animal species in images. This model learns to recognize different animals through patterns such as shape, color, and texture in the images.

Image Classification: Given a new image, the model processes the image to classify the species of animal present. Based on the timestamp and GPS data associated with the image, the model also suggests the optimal locations and times for spotting that species in the future.

Prediction & Assistance: Game drivers can upload images taken during their journeys, and the model will classify the animal, display relevant information about the species, and provide guidance on ideal times and locations to find similar animals
